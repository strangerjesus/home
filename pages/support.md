God, I feel so crass about this, but it's a necessary evil. There are lots of ways to support the show:

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=4668468">Patreon</a> for ongoing support (even a little helps!)</li>
	<li>PayPal for a one-time gift</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/keep-christianity-weird">GoFundMe</a> for our fundraisers</li>
	<li>Amazon Wishlist if you want to subsidize our book and equipment habit</li>
</ul>

We can even make arrangements for an old-fashioned check if you like.

However it happens, please know that your support means a lot to us. Thank you.
