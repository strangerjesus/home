You're encouraged to call my Google voice line: 262-477-9314 to:
<ul>
	<li>Make suggestions</li>
	<li>Offer reaction</li>
	<li>Ask questions (about show content or about spiritual/religious subjects you wonder about)</li>
	<li>Sing a hymn</li>
	<li>Anything else you can think of.</li>
</ul>

You can even attack me or the show, though I'll probably make fun of you and ignore you if I don't.

I'm always looking for people to read scripture. If you're willing, drop me a line.
