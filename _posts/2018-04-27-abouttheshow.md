The brief sketch is "Christianity for weirdos": a blend of music, prayer, reflection (occasionally rants), conversations and interviews. The aim is to express the faith for people alienated from its traditional settings, and explore it in a fresh way for those who might not share it. Hopefully, the first episode will come out at the start of June.
